### Building Detection

Model: Faster R-CNN
Method: Fine-tune with building detection dataset


### Image Similarity

We would like to acknowledge the google colab notebook provided by https://dreamsim-nights.github.io/ .

Our image similarity models (used as metrics) include DreamSim, DINO, CLIP, and ViT.

The image similarity notebook was created based on the colab from DreamSim.

## Note

The current repo is still under construction.

Original datasets (NOAA, GSV) and model weights will be released along with the paper's review.
